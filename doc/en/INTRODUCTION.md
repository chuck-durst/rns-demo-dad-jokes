# Introduction  
  
## Presentation  
  
This starter was developed to simplify the implementation of a SSR React site with NextJs and Material-ui.

The initial idea was to allow the rapid implementation of a web application using a modern technical foundation but starting from a sufficiently complete base to get to the heart of the matter. 

As each project is unique, this starter has been designed to be as customizable as possible. This documentation has been written to help you familiarize yourself with some basic principles, but as always, it is by tinkering that you will really learn to take advantage of the features offered by this starter.

Be careful, however, the more you change the core of the project, the more complicated it will be to make any subsequent updates. If this starter does not meet some of your specific needs, do not hesitate to suggest a pull-request or ask us directly! :)
